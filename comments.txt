What's a movie to watch when you want a good cry?

1. Fox and the Hound. I still can't finish that movie without becoming a mess.

2. My Girl. I watched it for the first time during class in high school and my teacher had to pass around a box of tissues. 

3. The Land Before Time. I think we all know the scene.

4. Homeward Bound

6. Iron Giant. "Suuuperrrrmaaan"

7. Good will hunting always makes me cry 

8. Stepmom... it’s ruthless 

9. About Time. Don't let the fact that is a romantic comedy fool you. It will rip your heart to pieces

10. Fuckin' Dumbo. I've recently started watching old Disney films again and I remember how awful they can be. At least Dumbo ends happy, but most of the film is pretty sad.  
  
The part where the mouse takes Dumbo to see his mum made me tear up big time. 

11. Life is beautiful

12. Looking for a Friend for the End of the World.

Thought it was going to be a funny movie because of Steve Carrell but it's not.

13. Schindlers List for me. 

That scene where he is crying and regretting not saving more. Man. 

14. The Green Mile.

Every time.



15. Studio Ghibli's Grave of the Fireflies. Starts slow but becomes a heartbreaking tale.

EDIT: Good lord, my first Gold?! Thank you thank you thank you! :D

16. Big Fish

17. Apollo 13 always gets me, there's so much tension as they wait for radio contact at the end, and seeing the entire control room erupt in celebration is always touching in a way I can't explain.

18. I have seen Forrest Gump maybe 8 times and cried every time

19. Bridge to Terabithia

20. Hachiko.

21. Wall-E - The little "no....no, no, no"'s from Eve when she thinks he's blown up and when he doesn't know her and she freaks out. All the gross sobbing.

Wreck-It Ralph - When he destroys her car and she screaming for him to stop. Oh god, my heart strings.

22. Y'all remember The Brave Little Toaster?

23. What Dreams May Come

24. Simon Birch 

I'm Sorrrrrryyyy -Simon's voice

Heartwrenching film

25. Shawshank Redemption

26. P.S. I Love You

I cry throughout the whole movie. It just doesn’t stop.

27. Eternal Sunshine of the spotless Mind. It goofily portrays a really touching and serious thing that everyone goes through.

28. If you've ever been in a serious relationship that fucked you up, Blue Valentine. It's one of my favorite movies, but it usually takes me half a bottle of bourbon to get through. 

29. Spirited Away. That feeling of being away from home was so relatable to me as a kid who had just moved to a new country- made me bawl like a fucking baby when I first watched it.

30. Singing along with *Les Miserables* really does it for me. Some songs are just killers.

31. La Bamba is a movie guaranteed to make me cry. 

32. Edward Scissorhands

The last scene is my favourite. I can’t quote it cause it will spoil it for folks that haven’t seen it but I’m a total wreck EVERY time. 

33. Dear Zachary 

34. Marley and Me

35. Mary and Max. 

36. Pay it Forward. 

37. Never Let Me Go

38. The Elephant Man or The Pianist.


39. Toy Story 3

40. Train to Busan

Didn't expect to be crying at the end of a zombie movie.

41. A Monster Calls. I just watched it the other day on Netflix, and fuck the ending tore my heart out.

42. [Whale rider](https://youtu.be/eSuBMJpPBBo)

43. Dancer in the dark

44. Inside Out got me good. 

45. I think Pixar's Up! has pretty much the record for fastest tearjerker ever.

46. The secret life of Walter Mitty 

47. Steel Magnolias. 

48. Dead Poets Society. Every single time.

49. Interstellar.  Spoiler.....the part where they get back to the ship and 30 or so years have passed both there and back on earth, and they watch all the videos from their loved ones over the years.  It always gets me...such a sacrifice 

50. Room

51. Any movie that has a dog on the poster.

52. A silent voice. 

Its so human, it hurts to realize i could relate to a lot of the things in it.  

53. The Book Thief 

54. The Lion King. Every. Fucking. Time.

55. The Bicentennial Man (the final scene)

56. All dogs go to heaven

57. Hachi: A Dog's Tale

58. The Iron Giant. That scene where he essentially commits suicide for the greater good of humanity. "No following."

Fucks me up err time.

59. The Tale of Princess Kaguya. Holy shit, that movie

60. Million Dollar Baby

61. Terms of Endearment

62. Saving Private Ryan 

63. Beaches.  

64. Arrival, equal parts life affirming and devastating.

65. Lilo &amp; stitch

66. Man on fire
gets me every time

67. A walk to Remember

68. In Bruges always gets me. 

69. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is always a good one for me.

70. Lion

71. Manchester By The Sea 

72. Blood Diamond 

So fucking heart wrenching

73. Atonement.  Great film.  I've only watched it once, though, because I can't go through that pain again.

74. Brokeback Mountain

Heath Ledger sobbing into those shirts gets me every fucking time
